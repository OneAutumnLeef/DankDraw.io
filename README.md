## 👩🏻‍💻 DESCRIPTION
Welcome to DankDraw.io 🎭, a digital rendition of the classic game of pictionary, where players utilize a chatroom to guess answers and control gameplay. This project was heavily inspired by the popular online game, [*skribbl.io*](https://skribbl.io/).

DankDraw.io was made by [@OneAutumnLeef](https://github.com/OneAutumnLeef) (Deraj), [@Sharankarthick](https://github.com/Sharankarthick) (Sharan Karthick), [@SHAN2004-IIIT](https://github.com/SHAN2004-IIIT) (Shanmathe SA), [@MaithreyanM05](https://github.com/MaithreyanM05) (Maithreyan M) and [@YashwanthS-7](https://github.com/YashwanthS-7) (Yashwanth S)as part of our 2024 Global Game Jam. This whimsical platform merges memes, madness, and web development prowess into a sensational experience.

This game was created with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, with the help of runtime environments/frameworks/etc. such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), and [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) for our backend

* Type commands directly into the chatbox
* After starting a round (with the start command)
  * The chat will choose a random player as that round's drawer and will give them a keyword to draw out
  * Using the canvas's different pen colors and widths, the drawer will be given 1 minute to draw out their keyword
  * Using the chat, other players will type their guesses into the chat
  * The first one to guess the word gets a point added to their score!
  * If no one guesses it, the round is null and no one gains a point
 
### Other Details 🌟
* When someone's selected as the drawer, no one else can draw on the canvas. When start hasn't been activated, anyone can draw on the canvas
* When you first join the server, you're prompted to make your own username
* The chat announces when a user connects/disconnects
